    "Convective Inhibition is anti-CAPE (negative CAPE) in the lower troposphere. This is the region where a parcel of air if raised from the lower PBL would sink back down again. Another term for CIN is a capping layer. The capping layer must be broken before lower PBL based lifting is able to move into the +CAPE region of a sounding and develop into deep convection. \n",
    "\n",
    "CIN will be reduced by: 1) daytime heating, 2) synoptic upward forcing, 3) low level convergence, 4) low level warm air advection (especially if accompanied by higher dewpoints). CIN is most likely to be small in the late afternoon since daytime heating plays a crucial role in reducing it. "
