# Sounding analysis 

This storm prediction model was made from a wish to learn more about sounding data (Skew-T) analysis. We can see a lot from there and with a little help from radars and forecast models, this script can give you pretty good storm forecast. 

Just start the script and insert station ID, date and time for which analysis has to be made. It can analyse any station as long as data is available.

Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations and also storm analysis for one potentially very stromy day.
